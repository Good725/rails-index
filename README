Rails Indexes
==============

Scans your models and displays a list of columns that _probably_ should be indexed.

note: there should be mode fields depending on your application design and custom queries.
# Install: script/plugin install http://github.com/eladmeidar/rails_indexes/tree/master
# Run it: rake db:show_me_some_indexes


Future:

   Add an option to create a migration that adds all the needed indexes.
   Add an option to scan the application root tree for #find, #find_all_by and #find_by to get some more index-required columns.
